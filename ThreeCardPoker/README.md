
Three Card Poker combines elements of traditional poker and casino table games. Rules may vary depending on where you go. For this version of Three Card Poker there is only one dealer and one player.

The Basic Rules are as follows:

· The objective of Three Card Poker is to make the best poker hand with three cards, beating the dealer's hand. For this version to function as a pc game, there will be             an ultimate win or lose scenario over several played hands. To win the player needs to make the dealer go bankrupt, and losing means the player went bankrupt.

· Both the Dealer and the Player will start out having a set amount of money. The amount of money the player starts with, the dealer will start with double.

· The game begins with all players placing an "ante" bet to receive their cards. The dealer will match the players' “ante” bet.

· The player and the dealer are dealt three cards. The last card in the dealers’ hand will be placed face up, and the entire players' hand will be placed face up.  

· After looking at their cards, the player has two-options Fold or Play:

	1. Fold: If the player thinks they have a weak hand, they can fold and forfeit their ante. The dealer does not place a “play” bet.

	2. Play: If the player decides they want to keep playing, they must place a "play" bet, that is equal to or more than their ante bet. The dealers' “play” bet will equal the initial ante bet.

· After the player makes their decision, the dealer shows their hand. The dealer must have in their hand a Queen or higher to qualify.

· If the player folded and the dealer did not qualify, the dealers' ante bet is returned but the players' ante bet stays on the table and can be won or lost by the player on the next hand dealt.

· If the player folded and the dealer did qualify, the dealer wins the total of the ante bets.

· If the player chooses to play,  and the dealer does not qualify, the player wins the total of the ante bets, and the play bet is returned as a push.

· If the dealer qualifies and the players' hand is higher, the player wins the total of both the ante and the play bets.

· If the dealer qualifies and the players' hand is lower, both the ante and play bets are won by the dealer.

· If the player and dealer tie, both the ante and play bets push.

Scoring the hand rankings from highest to lowest:

	1. Straight Flush: Three consecutive cards of the same suit.

	2. Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank.

	3. Straight: Three consecutive cards, not all of the same suit.

	4. Flush: Three cards of the same suit, not in sequence.

	5. Pair: Two cards of the same rank.

	6. High Card: The highest card in the hand.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Aces are special when making straights. 
An Ace can count as either the highest card (above King) or the lowest card (below 2). 
This means you can make these Ace straights: A-2-3 (Ace is low) Q-K-A (Ace is high). 
Remember that cards must be in consecutive order, so K-A-2 is not a straight. 
When comparing straights, the highest card wins. Therefor Q-K-A beats A-2-3, even though both contain an Ace.
